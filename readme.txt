## Project Overview
Modern cloud systems produce millions of logs daily across microservices.  
Manually analyzing these logs is inefficient and error-prone.  

**Intelligent Log Insights** is a fully automated, AI-powered log analysis system that:
- Ingests logs in real time.
- Processes and stores them in Azure Cosmos DB.
- Summarizes insights automatically.
- Sends alerts through Azure Logic Apps.
- Exposes analytical APIs via FastAPI.
- Enables **semantic log search** using vector embeddings & Gemini AI.

## 🧠 Core Idea

> “Turning raw log data into intelligent, actionable insights using AI + Azure automation.”

This platform supports DevOps engineers and developers by:
- Automatically detecting anomalies and critical patterns.
- Sending early alerts before system degradation.
- Allowing natural language log queries (semantic search).
- Monitoring service performance continuously.
